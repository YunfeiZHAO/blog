# GSOC 2021
I am very happy to be accepted this year as a gsoc student in redhen lab. Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. Students work with an open source organization on a 10 week programming project during their break from school. [The organisation list for 2021 is listed here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/?sp-page=3)
